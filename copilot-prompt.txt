Project: Water Supply Management System

Objective:
Build a lightweight web-based system using **raw PHP and PDO** that allows users to register, log in, and place water tank delivery orders. The admin can view and update the status of all orders. The system uses **cash on delivery only**. No third-party packages, JavaScript frameworks, or frontend tools should be used.

Scope:
- Users can:
  - Register with name, email, phone, and password
  - Log in and maintain session
  - Place orders with quantity, delivery address, and optional delivery date
  - View their order history and status (Pending, In Progress, Delivered)
- Admins can:
  - Log in using manually seeded credentials
  - View all orders with user info
  - Update order status
- Features intentionally excluded:
  - Email/SMS notifications
  - Analytics, stats, or graphs
  - Online payment integration
  - User profile address (orders use custom address per request)
- Use simple `$_SESSION` for authentication
- Use only prepared statements with PDO for security
- Database schema consists of: users, admins, orders


Please generate clean, standard, readable, secure, functional PHP scripts with proper session checks and minimal HTML stubs.
